Monolithic application :-
**********************
In a Monolithic application  all the functionalities or all the components included in to a single application. 

Drawbacks :-
********

=> Dynamic Scaleup or Scale down is not possible for specific components of an application.
=> Maintaining application becomes very much complecated.
=> Change in one component would reflect other components.


Microservice is an architecture  which can address all the drawbacks of Monolothic applications.

MicroServices :-
*************-

	=>In a Microservice architecture we will identify the independent components of an application.
	=>We will develop every independent component as a different restful application.
	=>Microservices are group of restful applications.

Microservice is a small , independent, deployable unit.

Advantages of microservices :-
**************************
=> Microservices are by default cloudenables so that dynamic scaleup and scaledown is possible.
=> Maintaning the application become very easier. Change in one microservice does effect other microservices.
=> Enables easy release cycles.(Adding new features to the microservices then deploy into production enviroment).
=> Microservices enables the user to use different technologies.

Challenges in MicroServices :-
*************************
	1. Communication between one microservice to another microservice. This also called maintaining the bounderies of an microservices.

	2.Configuration Management would be challenging job.

		Refer MicroServices Configuration diagram.

	3. Dynamic scale up and Dynamic Scale down for microservices. This also called as LoadBalancing.
	
	4. Visibility : 

		Debuging the microservice would be complicated. Monitoring available microservices.

	5. Fault Tolarence

		Sending default responses when the microservice is down.
